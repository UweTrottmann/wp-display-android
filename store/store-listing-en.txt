== Display temperature and status of heat pump, heating and hot water

Display temperature and status of heat pump, heating and hot water of heat pumps controlled by the Alpha-InnoTec Luxtronik 2.0 controller.

This is an OSS alternative to the controller-provided Java applet, which does not work on mobile devices. You must be connected to the same network as the controller (so for remote access you may use a VPN connection into your home network).

You can currently only display values, not change settings.
