## Installation

### Google Play

[Download on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uwetrottmann.wpdisplay)

### GitHub

The Android Package (APK) for each production release is attached to its associated
[GitHub release](https://github.com/UweTrottmann/wp-display-android/releases/latest).

However, I **recommend to use an update manager app** to ensure the latest updates are installed
automatically or you are notified about new updates. For example:

Or manually add it using the following URL:
